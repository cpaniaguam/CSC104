        "An important part of the business of Statistics is to generalize conclusions obtained from a sample to the whole population it was taken from. For example, one might be interested in estimating a population parameter (like a mean or proportion) by looking at a sample statistic. The problem with this approach is that if we take a second sample from the same population we will almost surely get a different estimate. Thus it is important to understand how these estimates vary from sample to sample. To this end, sampling distributions play an important role.\r\n",
